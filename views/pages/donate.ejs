      <h2>Why should I donate?</h2>
      <p>The Random User Generator API is a 100% free service and is paid for out of our own pockets. <strong>We generate up to a million random users a day</strong>, and the bandwidth involved to deliver that information is costly. Random User Generator will never require a paid subscription to use our service, and we strive to continue providing this service free to you for life. Donating isn't required, but it will help us continue to improve and enhance our service.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, we also earn money from you clicking on the verious advertisements you see on the site. If you aren't seeing ads, it's most likely because you are running an adblock service. We don't blame you, we hate ads too! However it would help us out a lot of you disabled your adblock service for our website.</p>
      <p>If not, that's cool too. We love you either way.</p>
